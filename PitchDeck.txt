ResiliNet — One-Page Pitch Deck

Slide 1 — Title / Hook
Title: ResiliNet — Neighborhood coordination when it matters most
Subtitle: Real-time local alerts, safe-location mapping & community help board
Footer: Pilot-ready React Native app + admin dashboard
Speaker notes: ResiliNet connects neighbors, NGOs, and local government to respond faster in climate and emergency events.

Slide 2 — Problem
Heading: The problem we solve
- Communities lack a simple, localized coordination tool during extreme events
- Centralized alerting doesn’t show local shelter status, volunteer capacity, or neighbor offers
- Recipients and responders miss matches (food, shelter, transport)
Speaker notes: Use local examples during pitch (flooding, heatwaves, wildfire evacuations). Offer the app as a local layer that fills the gaps.

Slide 3 — Solution (ResiliNet)
Heading: The solution — ResiliNet
- Live local alerts (verified by orgs + public feeds)
- Map of safe places and open services (shelters, clinics)
- Help Board: post & accept offers/requests (food, shelter, transport)
- Admin dashboard for municipalities & NGOs to verify and publish critical info
Speaker notes: Emphasize speed of adoption: cross-platform mobile, low-cost Firebase backend, and pilot-ready admin.

Slide 4 — Traction & Revenue Model
Heading: Traction & monetization
- Pilot region: [insert pilot city/region] — [X] installs, [Y] active users
- Revenue: Organization subscriptions (Org+ dashboard), sponsorship/CSR, grants, municipal contracts
- Go-to-market: Pilot partnerships with 1–3 municipalities, outreach via emergency management offices, community organizations
Speaker notes: If no metrics yet, pitch the potential: typical municipality pilot fee $2k–10k onboarding + $49–199/month for SaaS seats.

Slide 5 — Ask & Next Steps
Heading: What we need / Offer to buyer
- Seeking pilot partners and a buyer/partner to scale to 10+ municipalities
- Deliverables: full source code, admin panel, onboarding docs, 30-day tech support
- Next step: schedule a pilot in 1 region (2–3 month pilot) or request code handover
Speaker notes: End by asking for a meeting: “If you manage emergency services, a 30-minute pilot walkthrough is the next step.”
